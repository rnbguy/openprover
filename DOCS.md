# OpenProver internals

## Architecture

OpenProver uses a **planner-worker** architecture. A single planner LLM coordinates the proof search by maintaining a whiteboard and repository, spawning focused worker tasks that run in parallel. All state lives on disk for resumability.

## Planner-worker model

**Planner** (runs every step):
- Maintains a **whiteboard**: terse mathematical scratchpad (LaTeX, abbreviations)
- Manages a **repository** of items: lemmas, observations, failed attempts, literature findings
- Receives: whiteboard + repo index (one-line summaries) + last 3 outputs (rolling window)
- Outputs: TOML decision with action, summary, updated whiteboard, and action-specific fields

**Workers** (spawned on demand, parallel):
- Receive a task description from the planner
- Can reference repo items via `[[wikilink]]` syntax (resolved before sending)
- When `--lean-project` is set with a tool-capable worker model, workers have access to `lean_verify` and `lean_search` tools via MCP (Claude) or native tool calling (vLLM)
- Report free-form results back to the planner

**Repository** (`repo/` directory):
- Each item is a `.md` file: `Summary: One sentence.\n\nFull content`
- Planner can create, read, update, or delete items
- Used to persist proven lemmas, observations, literature reviews, failed approaches

## Modules

### `cli.py`

Entry point. Parses arguments, creates a `Prover` and `TUI`, installs signal handlers, runs the prover, prints cost summary on exit.

Subcommands:
- `openprover <theorem>` -- main proving loop
- `openprover inspect [run_dir]` -- browse a historical run
- `openprover fetch-lean-data` -- download Lean Explore search data and models

The LLM client is constructed via a factory pattern: `Prover` calls `make_llm(archive_dir)` after setting up the work directory, so the archive path is correct from the start. Separate planner and worker models are supported via `--planner-model` and `--worker-model`.

Run configuration is saved to `run_config.toml` in the work directory on fresh starts and restored on resume. CLI flags override saved values.

### `budget.py`

Tracks proving session budget in two modes:
- **Time budget** (`--max-time`, default `4h`): wall-clock seconds
- **Token budget** (`--max-tokens`): cumulative output tokens

The `Budget` class tracks elapsed time/tokens and exposes `is_exhausted`, `should_conclude` (at `--conclude-after` fraction), and `can_give_up` (at `--give-up-after` fraction). The planner prompt receives budget status so it can pace itself.

### `prover.py`

The `Prover` class owns the proving loop and all state.

**Init:** Creates or resumes a run directory (`runs/<slug>-<timestamp>/`). Loads or initializes the whiteboard. Creates the `Repo` instance. Resume is detected by checking for existing `WHITEBOARD.md` + `THEOREM.md`; step count inferred from `step_NNN` directories.

When `lean_worker_tools` is enabled, sets up tool calling for workers:
- **Claude CLI workers**: Configures an MCP server (`lean/mcp_server.py`) with `lean_verify` and `lean_search` tools
- **vLLM workers**: Initializes LeanExplore search service in-process and uses native OpenAI tool calling

**Step flow** (`run` -> `_do_step`):

1. **Planner call**: Build prompt from whiteboard + repo index + prev worker output. LLM call with streaming (shows in planner tab). Response must contain a `` ```toml `` block.

2. **Parse TOML**: Extract action, summary, whiteboard update, and action-specific fields (`[[tasks]]`, `[[items]]`, `search_query`, etc.) via `parse_planner_toml()`.

3. **Dispatch** to action handler based on the action field.

4. **Save step**: Write `planner.toml`, worker tasks/results, archive LLM calls, update `WHITEBOARD.md` on disk.

**Action handlers:**

| Handler | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `_handle_spawn` | Run worker tasks in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor` (up to `--parallelism`). Each worker gets its task description with wikilinks resolved. Results pushed to output window. |
| `_handle_literature_search` | Spawn a web-enabled worker (Claude CLI with `WebSearch` + `WebFetch` tools). Results fed back to planner. |
| `_handle_read_items` | Fetch full content of requested repo items, push to output. |
| `_handle_write_items` | Create/update/delete repo items. Items with `format="lean"` are auto-verified via `lake env lean`. |
| `_handle_write_whiteboard` | Update the whiteboard without spawning workers. |
| `_handle_read_theorem` | Return THEOREM.md + THEOREM.lean + PROOF.md content to the planner. |
| `_handle_submit_proof` | Save proof to `PROOF.md`. If Lean theorem exists, also assembles and verifies Lean proof via `lake env lean`, writes `PROOF.lean` on success. |
| `_handle_give_up` | Terminate. Only allowed after the give-up threshold (default 50% of budget). |

**`Repo` class** (also in `prover.py`):
- `list_summaries()`: Returns index of all items (name + first-line summary)
- `read_item(slug)` / `read_items(slugs)`: Fetch content
- `write_item(slug, content)`: Create, update, or delete
- `resolve_wikilinks(text)`: Find `[[slug]]` references, return resolved text + appended reference materials

**Output window:** The planner sees the last 3 outputs in a rolling window (via `_push_output()`). Outputs persist across steps until pushed out by newer ones. This gives the planner more context about recent progress.

**Operating modes** (determined by CLI args):

| Mode | Inputs | Goal | Terminates when |
|------|--------|------|-----------------|
| `prove` | THEOREM.md | Informal proof | `submit_proof` -> PROOF.md |
| `prove_and_formalize` | THEOREM.md + THEOREM.lean | Both proofs | PROOF.md + PROOF.lean both exist |
| `formalize_only` | THEOREM.md + THEOREM.lean + PROOF.md | Formal proof | `submit_proof` succeeds -> PROOF.lean |

**Worker tool execution** (when `lean_worker_tools` is enabled):

For the vLLM path, tools are executed in a multi-turn loop: the LLM requests tool calls, `_execute_worker_tool()` dispatches to `_tool_lean_verify()` or `_tool_lean_search()`, results are appended to the conversation, and the LLM continues.

For the Claude CLI path, tool execution is handled by the MCP server subprocess. Tool call events are detected from the stream and reported to the TUI via `add_worker_action()`.

**Other methods:**
- `_write_discussion()`: Post-session analysis via LLM call
- `is_finished`: Check if run completed (mode-aware: checks for required artifacts)
- `inspect()`: Browse a historical run in read-only mode
- `_load_history()`: Restore step history from disk for inspect mode

### `llm.py`

Two LLM client implementations with the same interface.

**`LLMClient`** (Claude CLI wrapper):

Non-streaming:
```
claude -p --model <model> --system-prompt <...> --output-format json --tools ""
```

Streaming:
```
claude -p --model <model> --system-prompt <...> --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages --tools ""
```
Uses `Popen` + `readline()` (not the line iterator, which has read-ahead buffering that defeats real-time streaming). Parses NDJSON lines, dispatches `content_block_delta` text to the callback.

Web search: When `web_search=True`, replaces `--tools ""` with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions --allowedTools WebSearch WebFetch`.

MCP tool calling: When `mcp_config` is set, adds `--mcp-config <json> --strict-mcp-config --permission-mode bypassPermissions --allowedTools mcp__lean_tools__lean_verify mcp__lean_tools__lean_search`. Tool events are detected from the stream:
- `tool_use` content blocks are tracked by their ID (capturing tool name and input as they stream in)
- Tool results appear as top-level `{"type": "user"}` messages (not as content blocks), containing `tool_result` entries matched by `tool_use_id`
- MCP prefixes are stripped from tool names (`mcp__lean_tools__lean_verify` -> `lean_verify`)
- Status is inferred from result text (e.g., `lean_verify` results starting with "OK" = success)

Archiving: Every call saved to `archive/calls/call_NNN.json` with full prompt, system prompt, schema, response, cost, timing, and errors.

**`HFClient`** (OpenAI-compatible HTTP, for vLLM):
- Calls an OpenAI-compatible API at `--provider-url`
- Health check on init (`/health` endpoint)
- Streaming via chunked transfer encoding
- `chat()` method for multi-turn tool calling conversations
- Same interface as `LLMClient` (web_search and json_schema ignored)
- Cost always 0.0 (local model)
- Automatically enforces `--isolation`

**Key gotchas:**
- `--json-schema` puts structured output in `raw["structured_output"]`, not `raw["result"]`
- `--tools ""` disables all tools (pure reasoning mode)
- Cost tracking uses `total_cost_usd` from the Claude CLI response

### `prompts.py`

All prompt templates, the TOML parser, and the actions enum.

**Actions:**
```python
ACTIONS = ["submit_proof", "give_up", "read_items", "write_items",
           "spawn", "literature_search", "read_theorem", "write_whiteboard"]
```

**System prompts:**
- `planner_system_prompt(...)`: Built dynamically. Instructs the planner to coordinate proof search, maintain whiteboard, manage repo, delegate to workers. Accepts `lean_mode` and `num_sorries` to conditionally include Lean-specific actions and principles. Key rules: `submit_proof` terminates the session (must have verified proof), `give_up` only after the threshold.
- `worker_system_prompt(lean_worker_tools=False)`: Instructs worker to complete its task rigorously. When `lean_worker_tools=True`, documents `lean_verify` and `lean_search` tools. If verifying, be skeptical and end with `VERDICT: CORRECT` or `VERDICT: INCORRECT`.
- `SEARCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: Instructs literature search worker.

**Prompt formatters:**
- `format_planner_prompt(whiteboard, repo_index, prev_outputs, ...)`: Planner input (prev_outputs is a list of up to 3). Includes status indicators for theorem statement, Lean statement, informal proof, and formal proof.
- `format_worker_prompt(task_description, resolved_refs)`: Worker input
- `format_search_prompt(query, context)`: Literature search prompt
- `format_initial_whiteboard(theorem, mode)`: Template with Goal / Strategy / Status / Tried. Includes mode banner for lean modes.
- `format_discussion_prompt(...)`: Post-session analysis

**TOML parser** (`parse_planner_toml`):
- Extracts TOML from `` ```toml...``` `` fenced block (or bare TOML at end of response)
- Uses `tomllib` (Python 3.11+) or `tomli` (3.10 fallback)
- Falls back to a minimal regex-based parser if neither available
- Handles `[[tasks]]`, `[[items]]`, and `[[lean_blocks]]` array-of-tables syntax
- Post-processes `lean_block_N` numbered keys into a `lean_blocks` list (both styles accepted from LLMs)

### `lean/core.py`

Lean 4 integration -- all formal verification logic isolated here.

**`LeanTheorem`**: Parses a THEOREM.lean file.
- Extracts preamble (import/open lines at top), locates all `sorry` positions via `\bsorry\b` regex
- `assemble_proof(replacements, context)`: replaces each sorry with its corresponding block (in reverse order to preserve offsets), injects optional context after preamble. Validates: correct count, no `import` in injected code.

**`run_lean_check(lean_file, project_dir, timeout=300)`**: Runs `lake env lean <file>` from the project directory. Returns `(True, "")` if returncode 0 and empty stdout; otherwise `(False, feedback)` with combined stdout/stderr.

**`LeanWorkDir`**: Manages an `OpenProver-{random_8hex}` subdirectory within the Lean project. Generated lean files go here with `{slug}-{random_6hex}.lean` naming. The final verified proof is written as `PROOF.lean`.

### `lean/mcp_server.py`

MCP server exposing `lean_verify` and `lean_search` tools for Claude CLI workers. Runs as a subprocess spawned by Claude CLI via `--mcp-config`. Communicates over stdio using JSON-RPC (MCP protocol).

- **`lean_verify(code)`**: Writes code to a temp file in the Lean work directory, runs `run_lean_check()`, returns "OK -- no errors" or compiler output.
- **`lean_search(query)`**: Searches Lean 4 declarations using LeanExplore. Returns matching names, signatures, and docstrings.

Environment variables `LEAN_PROJECT_DIR` and `LEAN_WORK_DIR` are set by the prover when spawning the MCP server.

### `lean/data.py`

Manages LeanExplore search data and dependencies.

- `is_lean_data_available()`: Checks for lean-explore package, torch, sentence-transformers, and fetched data files
- `fetch_lean_data()`: Installs missing dependencies (lean-explore, torch CPU, sentence-transformers), fetches search data via `lean-explore data fetch`, and pre-downloads the embedding model

Called automatically on startup when `--lean-worker-tools` is enabled and data is missing. Also available as `openprover fetch-lean-data`.

### Lean Explore search pipeline

The `lean_search` tool searches ~400k Lean 4 declarations (Init, Batteries, Lean, Mathlib, Std) using a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **BM25 retrieval** (~0.01s): Keyword search over LLM-generated natural language descriptions ("informalizations") of each declaration. Two indices with different tokenization strategies, results merged.

2. **Semantic retrieval** (~1s): Encodes query with Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B (sentence-transformer, 1024-dim), searches pre-built FAISS index for nearest neighbors by cosine similarity.

3. **Score fusion**: Normalizes both score sets to [0,1], combines as `0.3 * bm25 + 0.7 * semantic`, applies dependency boost for related declarations.

4. **Reranking** (GPU only, ~1-2s; skipped on CPU): Cross-encoder scoring with Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B. Disabled on CPU where it takes ~50s per query.

5. **Hydration**: Looks up full metadata (signature, docstring, source) from SQLite.

First call takes ~10s (model loading from disk). Subsequent calls ~1s.

Data is fetched once via `openprover fetch-lean-data` or automatically on first use. Stored in `~/.lean_explore/cache/`.

### `tui.py`

Full-screen terminal UI using ANSI escape codes and scroll regions.

**Layout:** Rows 1-4 are a fixed header (theorem name, step counter, model, tab bar). Row 5+ is the scrolling content area.

**Tab system:**
- Always has a `planner` tab (fixed)
- Spawn and search steps create worker tabs dynamically
- Tab bar shows status indicators: checkmark = done, ellipsis = streaming
- Left/right arrows switch tabs instantly

**Views:** `main` (log + streaming trace), `whiteboard`, `help`, `step_detail`, `input` (worker task on worker tabs).

**Key handling:** Background thread reads stdin in cbreak mode via `select()` + `os.read()`. Instant keys (work during streaming): `r`, `i`, `w`, `a`, left/right, up/down, PgUp/PgDn, `?`. Queued keys (during confirmation): `Tab`, `Enter`, `s`, `p`, `q`, `Esc`.

**Worker action display:** When workers use `lean_verify` or `lean_search`, each tool call appears as a navigable entry in the worker tab. Up/down arrows cycle through actions, Enter opens a detail view showing the tool input and result.

**Streaming:** Braille spinner while waiting for first token (~12 FPS). Toggleable reasoning trace with `r`. Worker tabs show their own streaming output independently.

**Confirmation UI:** Two-option selector (accept / give feedback) with text input. Up/down browse step history; Enter on a history entry opens detail view.

**Thread safety:** All stdout writes protected by `_write_lock`. Background key thread doesn't hold the lock during I/O.

### `inspect.py`

Read-only run browser. Loads a completed run directory and displays it in the TUI for review. Accessed via `openprover inspect [run_dir]` or automatically when resuming a finished run.

## Run directory

```
runs/<slug>-<timestamp>/
  THEOREM.md                   - immutable copy of input
  THEOREM.lean                 - formal Lean statement (if --lean-theorem)
  WHITEBOARD.md                - latest whiteboard state (enables resume)
  PROOF.md                     - written only if proof found
  PROOF.lean                   - formal Lean proof (if lean mode)
  DISCUSSION.md                - post-session analysis
  run_config.toml              - saved run configuration (for resume)
  repo/
    *.md                       - repository items (lemmas, observations, etc.)
  steps/
    step_001/
      planner.toml             - planner's TOML decision
      workers/
        task_0.md              - worker task description
        result_0.md            - worker output
        worker_0_call.json     - archived LLM call
    step_002/...
  archive/
    calls/
      call_001.json            - full LLM call record
```

**Slug format:** First 40 chars of theorem, lowercased, non-alphanumeric replaced with hyphens. Example: `sqrt2-irrational-20260220-143706`.

**Resume:** If the run directory contains `WHITEBOARD.md` + `THEOREM.md`, the prover picks up from the last completed step. Settings are restored from `run_config.toml`; CLI flags override saved values.

## Verification

**Informal verification** (all modes): Workers can be tasked with verification by the planner. A verifier worker sees only the proof text (not the reasoning that produced it) and must end its response with `VERDICT: CORRECT` or `VERDICT: INCORRECT`. The planner is instructed to verify proofs before submitting.

**Formal verification** (lean modes): When `--lean-project` is provided, the system supports automatic Lean 4 verification:

- **`write_items` with `format="lean"`**: Lean items are written to the `OpenProver-{id}/` subdirectory within the Lean project and verified via `lake env lean`. The planner receives pass/fail feedback with compiler errors.
- **`submit_proof`**: The planner provides N replacement blocks (one per `sorry` in THEOREM.lean) plus optional context. The system assembles the complete file, verifies it, and writes PROOF.lean on success. On failure, compiler errors are fed back.
- **`read_theorem`**: Returns THEOREM.md, THEOREM.lean, and PROOF.md (if provided) content so the planner can reference the formal statement.

**Worker tools** (when `--lean-worker-tools` is enabled): Workers can directly verify Lean code (`lean_verify`) and search Lean libraries (`lean_search`) during their reasoning. Tool calls are shown in the TUI worker tab.

Generated Lean files are placed in `<lean-project>/OpenProver-<random_id>/` with `{slug}-{random_suffix}.lean` names to avoid collisions. No `import` statements are allowed in injected code (enforced at assembly time).

## Wikilinks

Task descriptions can reference repository items via `[[slug]]` syntax. Before a worker receives its task, `repo.resolve_wikilinks()` finds all references, fetches the content, and appends it as a "Referenced Materials" section. This lets the planner share proven lemmas, observations, or literature findings with workers without duplicating content in every task.

## Adding a new action

1. Add the action name to `ACTIONS` in `prompts.py`
2. Describe it in `planner_system_prompt()` (format and when to use it)
3. Handle it in `Prover._do_step()` (add a `_handle_<action>` method)
4. Add a color in `ACTION_STYLE` in `tui.py`

## Adding a new worker tool

1. Add the tool function to `lean/mcp_server.py` (decorated with `@mcp.tool()`)
2. Add it to `WORKER_TOOLS` in `prover.py` (for vLLM tool calling)
3. Add a dispatch case in `_execute_worker_tool()` in `prover.py`
4. Add the `--allowedTools` entry in `llm.py` (MCP tool name)
5. Document it in `worker_system_prompt()` in `prompts.py`
6. Add a color in `TOOL_STYLE` in `tui.py`
